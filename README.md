# Standup order in JIRA (Chrome extension)

This Chrome extension lets you randomise a list of attendees on a JIRA scrum board to determine standup order.

Every day it will automatically reshuffle the list for you.

This Chrome extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/standup-order-in-jira/fnhgeigmbcphhhcffnbedlhkfodhoail).

## Development

This extension is built using Svelte and Vite. Use the command `npm run build` to create a production build in the `dist` folder.
